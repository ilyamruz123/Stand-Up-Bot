Pros/Cons of Software development with ChatGPT:
The biggest pros of using ChatGPT for software development is the ability for rapid prototyping and very quick code generation. Software program which would usually take days/months to write can be written in seconds.
WIth a solid initial template, good software developers can edit the provided program from ChatGPT and implement it in their system. The biggest cons of using ChatGPT for software development are loss of knowledge and
debugging. If ChatGPT is used too much, the knowledge of software engineering and computer science as a whole decreases. Additionally, debugging a code you have not written is very difficult. Debugging an AI written 
code can prove very hard to do in a complex software system.
